# Algorithms in C

This repository is not one of my development projects.  
It is simply a **personal repository** where I practice and store various algorithms and data structure implementations in C.  

The purpose of this repo is mainly for my **learning and reference**.  
The code here may not always follow best practices or be optimized for production use, but it serves as a record of my progress while exploring concepts like arrays, linked lists, queues, and other fundamental topics in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  

Feel free to browse through the code if you find it useful, but please note that this is more of a **study repository** than a polished project.
